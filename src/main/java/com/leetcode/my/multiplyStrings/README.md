### 43. Multiply Strings

<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented 
as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, 
also represented as a string.

__Note:__ You must not use any built-in BigInteger library 
or convert the inputs to integer directly.

__Example 1:__
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
<b>Output:</b> "6"
</pre>

__Example 2:__
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
<b>Output:</b> "56088"
</pre>

__Constraints:__
* `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
* `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
* Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any 
  leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
