### 69. Sqrt(x)

<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and 
return _the square root of_ `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal 
digits are __truncated__, and only __the integer part__ of 
the result is returned.

__Note:__ You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent 
function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

__Example 1:__
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> x = 4
<b>Output:</b> 2
</pre>

__Example 2:__
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> x = 8
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., 
and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
</pre>

__Constraints:__
* <code>0 <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
